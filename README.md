# chat
 Chatbot is a simple bot build using java,it takes the source from a file so be sure to modify the file path in MyBot class.
 the file should be the format of Questions,answers.
   For example :
    how are you, i'm doing great.How about you?
 and make sure you dont leave any extra spaces after the last line as it would lead to out of bounds error.
 that's it,write to me in paneerselvam1157@gmail.com if you want to talk.
 Happy Coding :)
