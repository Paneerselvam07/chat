Chatbot is a simple bot build using java,it takes the source from a file named source.txt
the file should be in the format of Questions_answers.
For example :
    do you know me?_no i don't
and make sure you dont leave any extra spaces after the last line as it would lead to out of bounds error.
that's it,write to me in paneerselvam1157@gmail.com in case of queries.
Happy Coding :)
